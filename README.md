# Dynamic Dot Grid with Serial Communication

## Overview

This project creates a **dynamic grid of dots** uses HW3A, where the size of the large dots can be controlled using **serial communication** input. It integrates Arduino that sends analog values.

- **A0**: Controls the size of large dots.  


## Features

- **Dynamic Grid**:  
   - Alternating rows of large and small dots.  
   - Grid updates in real-time based on serial data.  
- **Serial Integration**:  
   - Connects to a microcontroller via serial communication.  
   - Continuously requests and reads data.  
- **Interactive Visuals**:  
   - Large dot size (`A0`) dynamically mapped between 10â€“100 pixels.
